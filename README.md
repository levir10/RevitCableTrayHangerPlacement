# RevitCableTrayHangerPlacement
a Revit addin designed to place Cabletray hangers on cable trays automatically.
 special feature added to recognize 2 parallel cable trays, and place a single hanger to grab both of them. 
 takes the cable trays as hosts - makes hangers move with cabletrays if they are being moved and adjusted.
